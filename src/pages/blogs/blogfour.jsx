      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Rise of ChatGPT</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        ChatGPT crossed 100 million users in just two months, outpacing giants like WhatsApp and Twitter. This remarkable growth has made it a focal point for individuals and organizations alike. But did you know that ChatGPT is a specific implementation of generative AI designed explicitly for conversational purposes? It’s a large language model (LLM) trained on extensive text data, enabling it to generate human-like responses to user prompts.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How Does It Matter to IT Teams?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Generative AI has rapidly evolved, offering incredible potential across various industries. For instance, Salesforce is utilizing generative AI to migrate their entire datacenter (~200,000 servers) from CentOS to Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The possibilities are endless, and AI extends beyond just customer service.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        IT leaders (CIOs, CDOs, CTOs, etc.) must understand and harness this technology to drive innovation and competitive advantage. Before exploring its transformative capabilities, it's essential to grasp the truths about generative AI.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding Generative AI</h2>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Defining Generative AI</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Generative AI refers to systems capable of generating new content—text, images, audio, and more. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, it relies on large datasets and advanced algorithms to create content that appears human-generated.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Generative AI vs. Other AI Types</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Generative AI differs from other types, such as supervised and unsupervised learning. While supervised learning learns from labeled data, generative AI creates new data. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for leveraging generative AI effectively.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The Importance of Data</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The quality and quantity of data significantly impact generative models' performance. Collecting and curating large datasets is essential for developing and training these models. An open, hybrid, and governed data store is the solution.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Training and Models</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Generative AI models are trained using vast datasets and require powerful hardware. Notable models include OpenAI's GPT series, which set benchmarks in natural language processing. IT leaders need to understand the computational requirements and infrastructure necessary for these models.
