      Software-Defined Approach – Defining the Future
    </h1>

    <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6 mb-10">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The software-defined approach is revolutionizing how organizations operate, enabling greater flexibility, scalability, and efficiency across various industries. By abstracting hardware resources and allowing software to control them, businesses can adapt to changing demands and innovate rapidly. In this article, we’ll explore what a software-defined approach entails and its implications for the future.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is a Software-Defined Approach?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        A software-defined approach refers to the practice of using software to control and manage hardware resources. This paradigm shift allows organizations to separate hardware from software, enabling dynamic resource allocation and management. Key areas of application include software-defined networking (SDN), software-defined storage (SDS), and software-defined data centers (SDDC).
